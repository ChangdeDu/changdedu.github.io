I am currently a Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://www.ia.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences </a> (CASIA), Beijing, China.

Prior to CASIA, I was a Principal Engineer at the Cloud & AI, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. I obtained my PhD degree in the <a href="https://bii.ia.ac.cn/" target="_blank">Research Center for Brain-inspired Intelligence</a>,  CASIA, Beijing, China, supervised by <a href="http://www.ia.cas.cn/sourcedb_ia_cas/cn/iaexpert/200908/t20090804_2310528.html" target="_blank">Huiguang He

My research focuses on 1) ... . 2)... .
